## 🚀 About Me
Hey, I am Jaguar Liu, A full-stack developer who is passionate about programming and developing some small gadgets. Working at  Tencent.

Creator of [ChatGPT AI 问答助手](https://gitee.com/ashbur-e/chatbot-api-go), [Lottery 抽奖系统](https://gitee.com/ashbur-e/lottery), [菜鸟新闻](https://gitee.com/ashbur-e/rookie-news), [全链路监控中间件](https://gitee.com/ashbur-e/java-agent-link-monitoring), [基于Hash的数据库分库分表组件](https://gitee.com/ashbur-e/ashbur-db-router-spring-boot-starter) and others.

Dreaming up ideas and making them come true is where my passion lies. You can find my full projects list here.

Outside of programming, I enjoy doing photography and traveling. If you happen to be in the same city I live (currently in Xi|an), maybe we can hang out and take some photos or code together.
